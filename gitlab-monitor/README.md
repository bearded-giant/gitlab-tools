# GitLab Monitor - K9s for GitLab

A K9s-style Terminal User Interface for monitoring GitLab pipelines with real-time updates, interactive navigation, and detailed job inspection.

## Installation

### Method 1: Install from source (recommended for development)
```bash
# Clone and install in development mode
git clone <repo-url>
cd gitlab-monitor
pip install -e .
```

### Method 2: Install as package
```bash
cd gitlab-monitor
pip install .
```

### Method 3: Install directly from git
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/gitlab-monitor.git
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
export GITLAB_URL=https://gitlab.example.com
export GITLAB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
export GITLAB_PROJECT=group/project

# Optional
export GITLAB_REFRESH_INTERVAL=30  # seconds between auto-refresh
```

### Config File (Optional)
Configuration can also be stored in `~/.config/gitlab-monitor/config.json`:
```json
{
  "gitlab_url": "https://gitlab.example.com",
  "project_path": "group/project",
  "refresh_interval": 30,
  "max_pipelines": 50
}
```

Note: Never store tokens in config files. Always use environment variables for tokens.

## Quick Start

2. Type branch name (e.g., "feature-xyz")
3. Tab to user filter if needed
4. Click "Apply" or press Enter

### Investigating Failures
1. Navigate to a pipeline with failed status (red)
2. Press Enter to see jobs
3. Failed jobs will be highlighted in red
4. Press 'f' to see only failed jobs
5. Press Enter on a failed job to see extracted failures

### Opening in Browser

- ‚ùå Failed (red, bold for emphasis)
- üîÑ Running (yellow)
- ‚è∏ Pending (dim)
- ‚è≠ Skipped (dim)
- üö´ Canceled

## Auto-Refresh

The TUI automatically refreshes the current view every 30 seconds to show:
- New pipelines
- Updated job statuses
- Changed pipeline states

## Architecture

```
PipelineMonitor (App)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PipelineListScreen
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DataTable of pipelines
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JobListScreen
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DataTable of jobs (grouped by stage)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JobDetailScreen
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TextLog with trace/failures
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FailedJobsScreen
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TextLog with all failures
```

## Tips

1. **Quick failure investigation**: From pipeline list, look for red ‚ùå status, Enter ‚Üí press 'f' for failed jobs ‚Üí Enter on job to see failures

2. **Monitor specific branch**: Use filters to watch only your branch's pipelines

3. **Bulk failure review**: Use Failed Jobs view ('f' from job list) to see all failures at once

4. **Browser fallback**: If you need more details, 'b' opens the current item in GitLab's web UI
